## About PI
[**Qijia Shao**](https://qijiashao.github.io/) will join the [**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)**](https://hkust.edu.hk) as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in fall 2024. His research focuses on mobile computing, ubiquitous computing, and human-computer interaction. During his Ph.D., he has published several papers in top journals and conferences in his field (e.g., MobiSys, IMWUT/UbiComp, MobiCom, NSDI, CHI) and has received multiple awards including MobiSys Best Paper Award, MobiSys Best Demo Award, MobiCom Best Demo Award, Hotmobile Best Demo Award, UbiComp Best Teaser Award, and NSF Awesome Discoveries. He was also named among ACM MobiSys Rising Stars, NSF Rising Stars in Cyber-Physical Systems. During his Ph.D., he has worked at Philips Research, Snap Research, and Samsung Research, where several of his proposed algorithms are being deployed in real-world products.

## Research Area
We are passionate about solving real-world challenges with societal impacts. Our recent research focuses on building practically deployable systems. Specifically, human data can be divided into physical signals (e.g., motion, force, velocity) and physiological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram/ECG, electromyogram/EMG, brainwaves/EEG, body impedance). Human states are primarily influenced by physiological signals and manifested through physical signals. By efficiently acquiring and interpreting these signals, we can thoroughly understand human states and use them to address practical issues in various fields (including but not limited to **healthcare, education, and interactive entertainment**), thereby improving the quality of human life. We will address issues in two main areas:
- **Hardware System Design**: Building systems to capture the desired data while minimizing user awareness of the system's presence (imperceptibility).
- **Software Algorithm Implementation**: Leveraging the collected data to design algorithms that are generalizable to new user polulation and enrionments while maintaining low computation overhead.

## What We Expect From You
1. Enjoy conducting research that has practical applications and validating your proposed theories in the real world.
2. Have a strong self-drive, be eager, and be able to quickly learn new knowledge in various fields. 
3. Relevant research experience and demonstrable research capabilities (e.g., papers, projects, design competitions). 
4. A degree in computer science, artificial intelligence, electrical engineering, electronic information/communications engineering, automation, industrial design, mathematics, physics, or a related field. 
5. Have seriously considered and understood the process of pursuing a Ph.D. and still be interested in trying it. 
6. Be reliable, responsible, and have good communication skills, willing to communicate and share.

## My Support
I am very willing to support my students in all aspects of their development. I will offer:
- **Resources**: Ph.D. students will receive a full scholarship (18,000+ HKD/month, with exceptionally outstanding candidates recommended for [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme/HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme)( 27,000+ HKD/month) and ample research facilities and computational resources.
- **Individual Attention and Guidance**: We will meet at least once a week. I am very willing to spend time discussing with you, as this is a major reason I chose academia. You will have considerable freedom to formulate your own research ideas and implement them. I will help you every step of the way, ensuring you never lack guidance, especially in the early stages of joining our lab.
- **Clear Expectations**: Pursuing a Ph.D. and conducting research can be a confusing and lonely journey. Based on my personal experience and communications with other Ph.D. students, I believe clear expectations from a mentor are very helpful. I will strive to clarify my expectations to help you understand your situation better. I also support appropriate recreational activities and vacations, as it is sometimes necessary to take a breather and refresh yourself.
- **Internships and Visiting Scholars**: During my own Ph.D., I benefited greatly from research internships. I fully support you in undertaking internships related to your research direction and am willing to internally recommend various internship opportunities (in China, the USA, Japan, Korea) as needed. I have connections with many universities overseas (mainly in the USA). Depending on your willingness and opportunities, I will support you in visiting and exchanging.
- **Travel**: I encourage students to attend conferences. I will support you to present our works at conferences. This was one of my favorite parts of my own Ph.D., the "free travel."
- **Guidance in Writing, Speaking, and Other Skills**: Pursuing a Ph.D. is not just about technical expertise. I will help you improve your writing, speaking, social, and other skills to help you become a researcher with excellent communication skills.
- **Entrepreneurial Support**: The unique entrepreneurial atmosphere and strong industrial chain resources at HKUST will also provide you with significant entrepreneurial support. Our research directions ultimately require creating prototypes and testing them in the real world, which is often the first step for many startups. Therefore, when good opportunities and appropriate conditions arise, I will also support you in leveraging our research for entrepreneurship.

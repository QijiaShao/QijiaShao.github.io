* Welcome, my name is Qijia Shao,  currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/) at [**Dartmouth College**](https://home.dartmouth.edu/). I am a member of the [DartNets](http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/) (Dartmouth Networking and Ubiquitous Systems) Lab and [RLab](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/) (Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab), under the supervision of [**Professor Xia Zhou**](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xia/) and [**Professor Devin Balkcom**](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/).

* I received my bachelor's degree with the highest honor from Yingcai Honors College at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2018. In 2016, I was an exchange student at EECS department of [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en).  I spent my senior year as a research assistant at [Missouri S&T](https://www.mst.edu/), advised by [Professor Y. Rosa Zheng](https://www.lehigh.edu/~yrz218/).

<!-- * During my undergraduate study, I focused more on optimization and statistical signal processing in wireless communication. I am lucky to have been working at National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, advised by [Professor Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=bOK-froAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and at Center for Real-time Adaptive Signal Processing, advised by [Professor Y. Rosa Zheng](https://www.lehigh.edu/~yrz218/) -->

My current research spans a range of different topics in Mobile Computing, Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. Most of my research projects are problem-driven, aiming at solving interesting and impactful real-world challenges. I design, build and evaluate novel and practical mobile systems, especially **sensing systems**. I have developed **soft electronics and fabric sensing** system for continuous joint monitoring and 1-D touch input. I am recently investigating cyber-learning and technological assistance (e.g., **Mixed Reality**, AR, VR) for **teaching human motion tasks**, which includes reliable sensing of human body configuration, actuation for feedback-based guidance, algorithms for communicating motion and computational techniques for evaluating motion quality.

<!-- **I am actively seeking for a research intern position for summer 2021. Please ** -->

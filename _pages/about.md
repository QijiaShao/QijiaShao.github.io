<span style="color:red;"> **NEWS: I am currently recruiting Ph.D. students (Spring/Fall 2025), research assistants, and visiting students. For more details, please refer to** [Prospective Students.](https://qijiashao.github.io/student/) **Thanks!**</span>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p> Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://isd.hkust.edu.hk/">ISD division</a> at <strong><a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)<strong></a>. Prior to HKUST, I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science </a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/"><strong>Columbia University</strong></a> in 2024, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~xia/">Prof. Xia Zhou</a> and <a href="http://fredjiang.com/">Prof. Fred Jiang</a>. I received my master's degree from <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/"><span style="color:Green"><strong>Dartmouth College</strong></span></a>, and my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/"><strong>UESTC</strong></a>. I was an visiting student in my junior year at EECS department of <a href="https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en">National Chiao Tung University</a>. I spent my senior year as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.mst.edu/">Missouri S&T</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.lehigh.edu/~yrz218/">Professor Y. Rosa Zheng</a>.</p>

<p>Our lab is passionate about solving exciting and impactful real-world challenges. Our research recently focuses on <strong>lowering the barriers to acquiring and interpreting various human-related signals</strong>, from physical signals (e.g., motion, force, velocity) to physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EMG, impedance) and enabling applications in healthcare, education, and interaction.</p>

<!-- My research involves the application-driven aspects in Mobile Computing and Human-Computer Interaction. I develop novel sensing systems and robust data analytic techniques
to lower the barrier of acquiring and interpreting human physical (e.g., force, velocity, vision) and physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EMG, impedance), enabling applications on healthcare, education and interaction. My research methodology is interdisciplinary, in the sense that I draw inspiration from other disciplines such as clinical and health sciences, cognitive science, material science, and electrical engineering -->

<p>We play with various modalities of signals with <strong>integrated software-hardware co-designs.</strong> We have designed and prototyped different practical systems leveraging the latest technical advances (e.g., Multimodal Deep Learning, Mixed Reality/AR/VR, ) for  human motion teaching (soft flex/pressure sensors and camera @UIST'23, @CogSci'22, @UbiComp'21),  human activity/behavior monitoring/prediction (EMG and impedance sensors @UbiComp'21; computational fabrics @UbiComp'19, @MobiSys'24), localization and tracking (light @NSDI'24, @MobiSys'22), and interactions (N-euro Predictor @UbiComp'23; conductive threads @CHI'20). Feel free to contact me if interested in similar topics!</p>

I am passionate about solving exciting and impactful real-world challenges. My research recently focuses on **lowering the barriers to acquiring and interpreting various human-related signals**, from physical signals (e.g., force, velocity) to physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EMG, impedance) and enabling applications in healthcare, education, and interaction.

I play with various modalities of signals from both software and hardware sides. I have designed and prototyped different practical systems leveraging the latest technical advances (e.g., **Multimodal Deep Learning, Mixed Reality/AR/VR**) for  human motion teaching (soft flex/pressure sensors and camera @UIST'23, @CogSci'22, @UbiComp'21),  human activity/behavior monitoring/prediction (EMG and impedance sensors @UbiComp'21; computational fabrics @UbiComp'19 @MobiSys'24), localization and tracking (light @NSDI'24, @MobiSys'22), and interactions (N-euro Predictor@UbiComp'23; conductive threads @CHI'20).

The research was conducted during my internship at Snap. Check out the short [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWUvgxlaNUM&list=PLqhXYFYmZ-VdTsnSwophLk4-157aPiJwf&index=34) and the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610884) here. The same prediction scheme was leveraged in our [NSDI 2024](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/) paper for high-speed objects motion prediction.
